The reverse sear flips traditional steak cooking on its head. Instead of searing first, we start low and finish hot. The result? **Edge-to-edge medium-rare** with a crackling crust.

## Why Reverse Sear?

Traditional high-heat methods create a gradient—well-done edges fading to a pink center. The reverse sear minimizes this gradient by bringing the entire steak to temperature slowly.

Notice the gentle climb—this slow approach gives enzymes time to tenderize the meat while proteins denature evenly.

## The Science: Maillard Reaction

The crust forms through the **Maillard reaction**, which requires:
- Surface temperature above 280°F (140°C)
- Low moisture on the surface
- Amino acids + reducing sugars

<Callout type="tip" title="Pro tip">
Pat your steak bone-dry before the final sear. Surface moisture creates steam, which inhibits browning and costs you precious crust development time.
</Callout>

## Method

### Phase 1: Low & Slow (Oven)
1. Season ribeye generously with salt (ideally 24h ahead)
2. Place on wire rack over sheet pan
3. Bake at **225°F** until internal temp hits **120°F** (~25-35 min)

### Phase 2: The Sear
1. Heat cast iron until smoking (500°F+)
2. Add high smoke-point oil (avocado)
3. Sear **45 seconds per side**
4. Baste with butter, garlic, thyme

<Callout type="warning" title="Critical">
Rest for 5 minutes before slicing. Cutting too early loses up to 10% of juices.
</Callout>

## Results

The reverse sear produces:
- **90%+ edge-to-edge medium-rare** (vs ~60% traditional)
- Better enzyme activity = more tender
- Drier surface = superior crust
