## Overview

This is an unpretentious steak made with humble ingredients, tried-and-true methods, and a LOT of finetuning. This is not a 60-day dry aged american wagyu seared over a wood fired grill, but if you nail the meat selection and the cooking, it's 85% there.

## Method

### Phase 1: Dry Brine (8 hours)

1. **Salt**: Add **2% salt by mass** to steak, rub on all sides.

   <Callout type="question" title="Why 2% salt?">
     2% salt seems like a lot, but it's hard to over-salt steaks and some falls off. Individual preference also varies wildly, but slightly too salty is a lot tastier than not salty enough. Finetune to your own preference, which will likely be between 1 to 2.5%.
   </Callout>

2. **Pepper**: Add pepper to preference, rub on all sides.

3. **Garlic powder**: Add **4% by mass**, rub on all sides.

   <Callout type="question" title="Why so much garlic?">
     Garlic works incredibly well with steak. During the sear, it'll also slightly char to create a great flavor.
   </Callout>

4. **Dry brine**: Place on wire rack and refrigerate for **8 hours**.

   <Callout type="question" title="Why 8 hours?">
     You can dry brine anywhere from 1 hour to 24 hours. More time = more salt penetration and dryness, but overdoing it develops a tough "pellicle" which isn't pleasant to eat. 8 hours is the sweet spot, and over 16 hours is too much from my experimentation.
   </Callout>

### Phase 2: Low & Slow (Oven)

1. **Dry the surface**: Dab off all excess moisture with paper towels.

   <Callout type="warning" title="Surface moisture control">
     This step is absolutely necessary. It takes a lot of energy to convert water to steam, which takes away from the sear. Most home stoves are already underpowered, so even a **slightly** wet steak will ruin the sear.
   </Callout>

2. **Bake at 200°F** until center reaches **128°F**.

   <TempChart
     client:visible
     title="Internal Temperature Curve"
     targetTemp={128}
     ovenTemp={200}
     data={[
       { time: 0, core: 38, surface: 35 },
       { time: 10, core: 65, surface: 80 },
       { time: 20, core: 90, surface: 110 },
       { time: 30, core: 108, surface: 130 },
       { time: 40, core: 120, surface: 142 },
       { time: 50, core: 128, surface: 150 },
     ]}
   />

   <Callout type="question" title="Why bake at 200°F?">
     The lower the oven's temperature, the lower the difference between the surface and the core temperature during the slow baking phase. At 200°F, this difference is around 20°F by the time the center reaches 128. Higher temperatures develop a much bigger gradient, but up to 250°F is acceptable.
   </Callout>

   <Callout type="question" title="Why 128°F?">
     When baking at 200, there is a negligible amount (less than 1°F) of carryover cooking, especially for thinner steaks that you would normally find at a supermarket. Pulling at 128 locks the center temperature at a perfect medium-rare.
   </Callout>

### Phase 3: The Sear

1. **Heat the pan**: Add enough ghee to coat the bottom and heat until slightly smoking. Maintain at exactly that equilibrium (just above 500°F). Use an IR thermometer if unsure.

2. **Sear 30 seconds per side**, flipping until crust is deep brown. This should take **3 minutes maximum**. The slight thermal gradient is worth the extra crust.

   <Callout type="warning" title="Heat management">
     If your pan loses too much heat, take the steak off and let the oil start smoking again. Taking the steak off and putting it back on is completely acceptable—it allows heat recovery.
   </Callout>

3. **Sear the sides** for 30 seconds each. Take extra care around the fat cap—30 seconds could be too long and lead to charring. Check frequently.

### Phase 4: Serve Immediately

1. **No rest needed.** The "resting to retain juices" advice is a myth. It has applications for letting meat reach thermal equilibrium, but our steak is already in equilibrium from slow cooking. We actually *don't* want the surface heat to travel inside—cut immediately and serve.
